                                                                    This does not always mean that an introvert dislikes others company, it simply means you are overstimulated by it, which causes you to need time alone to regenerate that energy.
                                                                    An introverted nature thrives on structure, and in-depth exploration of yourself, including why you think and feel the way you do.
                                                                    When surrounded by outside stimulus, it is very hard to do this, meaning you need to move away from the stimuli to gather and restructure your thoughts.
                                                                    An introvert works better in your own space, as you think constantly on many levels.
                                                                    Once your set point is respected, you will be able to work and play more productively with a higher level of enjoyment.

                                                                            At a moderate level of introversion, you may feel a degree of natural energy depletion in the company of others.  
                                                                            It is common to feel good at one or 2 people stimulated events, but if this atmosphere is sustained for too long with no downtime, energy will start to decline. 
                                                                            A good example might be a party, followed by a group sleepover, being fun and energy filled, but if extended over a weekend or longer, agitation will result. This does not mean with moderate introversion you begin to dislike your friends, it simply means you are overstimulated if in the environment for too long, needing time alone to regenerate your energy. A moderately introverted nature usually prefers structure, and you have a curiosity about the way you think and feel, but not as deeply as someone who scores higher on the introversion scale. When surrounded by outside stimulus, at some point you will need to move away from the stimuli to gather and restructure your thoughts. A moderate introvert works well with others, but if left to choose would prefer to occasionally working in your own space, especially if the environment you work in is without a degree of structure. 
                                                                            Once your set point is respected, you will be able to work and play more productively with a higher level of enjoyment.

A good example might be studying alone without some social interruptions. 
                                                                                        For a while it will be productive and welcome, but if extended over a period of time, agitation will result. 
                                                                                        This does not mean with moderate extroversion you begin to dislike solo downtime, it simply means you are not stimulated if in this environment for too long, needing some people time to regenerate your energy.

                                                                                        When there is limited to no external stimulus, at some point you will need to surround yourself with external people or stimuli to get back to your most comfortable set point. A moderate extrovert works well on your own, but if left to choose would prefer to be working with others, especially when a decision needs to be made. 
                                                                                        Once your set point is respected, you will be able to work and play more productively with a higher level of enjoyment.

                                                                                                This does not always mean that an extrovert dislikes their own company, it simply means they are not stimulated by it, which causes them to need time with others or in a high stimulated space to regenerate that energy. 
                                                                                                An extroverted nature thrives on impulsive and spontaneous adventure, looking outside of yourself for inspiration, and sharing yourself completely with others, as well as openly talking about your thoughts and feelings. 
                                                                                                When alone, it is impossible to do this, meaning you need to source social stimuli to gather momentum relax. An extrovert works better in the company of others, and often acts before they think. 
                                                                                                Once your set point is respected, you will be able to work and play more productively with a higher level of enjoyment.

                                                                                        A good example might be studying alone without some social interruptions.

                                                                                        This does not mean with moderate extroversion you begin to dislike solo downtime, it simply means you are not stimulated if in this environment for too long, needing some people time to regenerate your energy. A moderately extroverted nature usually prefers some spontaneity, and you like to discuss and compare the way you think and feel with others, but, depending on the subject matter you may work somethings out by yourself. When there is limited to no external stimulus, at some point you will need to surround yourself with external people or stimuli to get back to your most comfortable set point. A moderate extrovert works well on your own, but if left to choose would prefer to be working with others, especially when a decision needs to be made.
                                                                                        Once your set point is respected, you will be able to work and play more productively with a higher level of enjoyment.
